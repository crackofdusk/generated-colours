# Notes

I had a demo with randomly positioned circles with random colours. I didn't like the generated colours. Three years later I stumbled upon an [article about colour variations](https://sighack.com/post/procedural-color-algorithms-color-variations). It inspired me to try the presented techniques in this demo.
